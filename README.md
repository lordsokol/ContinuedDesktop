Keep the Desktop active and circumvent the screensaver

This is a handy program to keep the desktop active and prevent the screensaver from kicking in.  In some cases, if you are working on a PC with access control restricted for certain settings like the screen saver and display settings for example, those settings can get in the way of the work you need to do.
The need for this program came from a case where I needed to continually view data being written to a database and having the screen time out on me every 15 minutes.   I had to view the data on one laptop while I worked on other processes on a separate laptop.
